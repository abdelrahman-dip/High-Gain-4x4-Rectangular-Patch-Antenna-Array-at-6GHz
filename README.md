# High-Gain-4x4-Rectangular-Patch-Antenna-Array-at-6GHz
Designed using the advanced CST Microwave Studio software, this antenna array comprises sixteen (4x4) rectangular patches to achieve a high gain. The choice of a 4x4 configuration ensures an enhanced directivity and improved signal strength, making it suitable for applications demanding higher data rates and wider coverage areas. The utilization of CST Microwave Studio for the design process ensures accurate simulation results, accounting for substrate effects, mutual coupling between the patch elements, and external environmental factors. This antenna design stands out for its capability to cater to the demands of next-generation wireless communication systems, especially in the 6GHz band.
